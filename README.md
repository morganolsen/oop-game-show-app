# OOP Game Show App
 This is my 4th techdegree project using object oriented programming concepts.

 I have done the following styles changes:
 - Made the font for the start game-button bold.
 - Made the "Phrase hunter" title a little darker on the start screen.
 - Made the background of a correct letter green instead of blue.
 - Made the background of a wrongly selected letter red instead of orange.
